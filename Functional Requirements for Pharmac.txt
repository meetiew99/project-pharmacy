Architecture of the Software
System Architecture
The proposed Pharmacy Management System (PharmEase) will be designed using a three-tier architecture:

Presentation Layer

Components: Web browser interface and mobile application.
Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js for web, React Native for mobile).
Purpose: Provides the user interface for interacting with the system. It allows users to input data, view reports, and manage pharmacy activities.
Business Logic Layer

Components: Application server.
Technologies: Node.js with Express.js framework.
Purpose: Processes user requests, implements business rules, and handles the core functionality of the system. It acts as a bridge between the presentation layer and the data layer.
Data Layer

Components: Database server.
Technologies: PostgreSQL for relational data storage.
Purpose: Stores all the system's data including medicine records, inventory, financial transactions, and user information. Ensures data integrity and efficient data retrieval.
Justification for Technological Stack
React.js and React Native: Chosen for their efficiency in building responsive and dynamic user interfaces. React Native allows for code reuse between web and mobile applications, reducing development time and costs.
Node.js and Express.js: Selected for their ability to handle concurrent operations efficiently. Node.js is known for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, making it suitable for applications requiring high performance and scalability.
PostgreSQL: Opted for its robustness, scalability, and support for complex queries. PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system known for reliability and data integrity, making it a solid choice for handling the comprehensive data needs of the system.
This architectural setup ensures that the system is modular, scalable, and easy to maintain. The use of modern and widely adopted technologies ensures that the system will be performant and secure, with a strong foundation for future enhancements and integrations.
